## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict the cost of Bitcoin. By leveraging historical Bitcoin price data and relevant market indicators, we aim to create a machine learning model capable of forecasting future price trends.

## Data

The data used for training the model is collected from various sources, including historical Bitcoin price data from cryptocurrency exchanges and other market indicators. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing numeric features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Model

For this project, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells as the machine learning model. This model architecture allows us to capture temporal dependencies in the data and make accurate predictions for time series forecasting tasks.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into the average prediction error and the overall deviation of the predictions from the actual Bitcoin prices.

## Challenges

Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges, including handling noisy data, addressing the high volatility of Bitcoin prices, and finding the right balance between model complexity and generalization. To mitigate these challenges, we applied data preprocessing techniques, experimented with different model architectures, and conducted rigorous evaluation and validation.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering techniques such as lagging, differencing, and rolling statistics are applied to create additional input features from the original dataset. These engineered features aim to capture patterns and trends in the Bitcoin price data, potentially improving the model's predictive performance.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project consists of stacked LSTM layers. By stacking multiple LSTM layers on top of each other, the model can learn hierarchical representations of the data and capture complex temporal patterns. The output layer is a fully connected layer that predicts the future Bitcoin price.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques such as grid search or random search. The hyperparameters considered for tuning include the number of LSTM layers, the number of hidden units in each layer, the learning rate, and the dropout rate. The specific values to try are determined based on prior knowledge and experimentation.

## Data Split

The data is split into training and testing sets using a chronological order-based approach. Typically, the earlier portion of the data is used for training, and the later portion is used for testing. Cross-validation techniques, such as time series cross-validation or rolling window cross-validation, are employed to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.

## Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting and underfitting are potential challenges in this project due to the complex nature of the Bitcoin price data and the limited availability of training data
